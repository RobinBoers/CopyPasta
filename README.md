# CopyPasta

CopyPasta is a VSCode extension that allows you to copy paste the code section of the first answer to your programming related question from Stack OverFlow.

This is my fork of the original CopyPasta extension by makman12. May conflict if both are installed and enabled at the same time.

## Usage and features

In your text editor just write what you would normally search on Google, then press 'ctrl+enter' you will get what you want. You don't have to add name of the language you are writing on because it will be automatically added.

Currently there three advanced options;

-   If you add '-s' to the end of the query sentence it will open the page for you.

    -   Also if you just write '-s' and press ctrl+enter it will open the page for your last search.

-   If you add '-l' to the end of the query sentence it will open a quicklist with all the code from the result

    -   Also if you just write '-l' and press ctrl+enter it will open the list for your last search.

-   If you just write a number, it will get that result from your last search

    -   Also if you write '-g' add the end of the query and it will get that result

-   Command will bring you the code section of the first comment if you want to get other comments you can just call it by number and then press ctrl+enter so if you just searched for a query and then wanted to see second comments code section you have to just type '2' and then press ctrl+enter. No need to searched it again.

Obviously if you have spesific enough problems you should check them out by yourself but if you just wanna know the syntax that you used for CopyPasta is your helper.
